**System Requirements**\  Java VM 6 or above BaasBox is compiled with
Java 1.6

1. Download the latest version from the `Download <http://www.baasbox.com/download/>`_, keep
   in mind that until the 1.0 version will be released, BaasBox is not
   production-ready and therefore subject to change. For Windows
   Platforms on the same page you will find the start.tar.gz file.
2. Unzip the file baasbox-x.x.zip wherever you want.
3. Only for Windows Platforms: unzip the start.tar.gz file and put the
   extracted start.bat in the same directory
4. Type:

   -  start.bat (on Windows)
   -  ./start (on linux, in this case pay attention to the eXecution
      flag)

BaasBox will start and will create the DB directory, then it will listen
on port 9000. Go to http://localhost:9000/
with your preferred browser. If everything worked fine, the BaasBox logo
should appear. Now you can open the Administrator Console:
http://localhost:9000/console For
further clarifications about the console, you can read the :doc:`console` Thatâ€™s all! BaasBox is ready to go and to serve your
Apps! To stop the server just halt (CTRL-C) the shell script.
